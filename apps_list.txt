1. Build a "Social Pulse" App in your Vault
    Instead of visiting X (Twitter) or LinkedIn directly, build a simple aggregator inside your app that pulls only what you need.

    The Hook: Use "Nitter" (a privacy-focused mirror for X) or RSS feeds for specific LinkedIn creators.

    Lucide Icon: Radio or Zap

    The Logic: You create a list of 5-10 high-value researchers (e.g., leaders in Federated Learning). Your app fetches their latest posts via RSS and displays them in a clean, text-only list. No "For You" algorithm, no ads, and no comments.

2. The "Daily Digest" (Research & Tech Feed)
    Instead of manually checking sites, you can build a light RSS/arXiv aggregator into your app.

    For your Research: Use arXiv API or SciURLs to pull the latest pre-prints in Federated Learning or Intrusion Detection.

    For your Dev side: Add feeds from Hacker News or Dev.to (Python/FastAPI tags).

    Vault Integration: When you see an interesting title, add a "Save to Bookmarks" button that sends the link directly to your existing BookmarksApp.

3. "Lockbox" (Secure File Sharing)
    You already have a SharedNote component. Why not expand this into a secure, expiring file-sharing utility?

    The Hook: Generate a "Burn-after-reading" link for a file or a credential.

    Lucide Icon: Flame or Share2

    Key Feature: Upload a file to your Firebase storage, encrypt it with a one-time key, and generate a link that deletes itself (via Firestore TTL or a Cloud Function) after 1 view or 24 hours.

4. Device Monitor / "Home-Lab Central"
    You have an ankit-lab server and a Jetson Orin Nano. This app would act as a dashboard for your hardware.

    The Hook: Monitor your server health directly from your suite.

    Lucide Icon: Cpu or Activity

    Key Feature: A simple status page showing if your StreamPi or Cloud Drive services are online. Since you're interested in IoT/CAN bus security, you could eventually add a "Security Log" that alerts you to unusual SSH login attempts on your lab.

5. 2FA Authenticator (Security Utility)
    Since you are already handling cryptoKey and passwords, adding a TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) authenticator makes your suite a true replacement for tools like Google Authenticator or Authy.

    The Hook: One less app to install on the phone; everything is in your Vault.

    Lucide Icon: ShieldCheck or Fingerprint

    Key Feature: A 30-second countdown timer that generates the 6-digit codes for other services.   

6. "Secure Share" (End-to-End Encrypted Messaging)
    Since you already have the crypto logic, you can build a simple, private messaging app that works between your devices (or with a friend).

    The Hook: A WhatsApp/Signal replacement that uses your own server and your own encryption keys.

    Lucide Icon: MessageCircle or Lock

    Key Feature: End-to-end encrypted 1-to-1 chat. You can send text, and later, encrypted images. Since it's built on your platform, you can add "Self-destruct" timers to messages.

7. Expense/Subscription Tracker (Financial Utility)
    You already have a BankingApp. Adding a Subscription Manager helps track recurring "drain."

    The Hook: Visualizes monthly burn.

    Lucide Icon: Repeat or Receipt

    Key Feature: A dashboard showing "Next Payment Due" and a total monthly cost of all active subscriptions (Netflix, Gym, etc.).
